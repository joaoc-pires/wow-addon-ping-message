# PingMessage

PingMessage is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon that plays a short sound whenever you receive a whisper. Its goal is simple: make sure you never miss an important message, even if chat tabs are hidden or the game window is not in focus.

## What it does

- Plays a “ping” sound when you receive a normal in-game whisper.
- Plays the same sound when you receive a Battle.net whisper.
- Lets you choose which audio channel the sound uses (Master, Music, Effects, Ambience, or Dialog).
- Saves your settings automatically between sessions.

The addon does not modify chat behavior, messages, or UI elements. It only adds an audible notification.

## Configuration

You can configure PingMessage directly from the World of Warcraft Settings menu:

1. Open **Settings** in-game.
2. Go to **AddOns**.
3. Select **Ping Message**.

Available options:
- **Whisper**: Enable or disable the sound for normal whispers.
- **Battle.net Whisper**: Enable or disable the sound for Battle.net whispers.
- **Sound Channel**: Choose which audio channel the ping sound uses.

## Why use it

PingMessage is useful if:
- You often miss whispers while focused on gameplay.
- You play with certain audio channels muted and want whispers routed elsewhere.
- You want a minimal solution without chat addons or UI clutter.

## Compatibility

- Designed for modern versions of World of Warcraft (including 12.0.0 and later).
- Uses Blizzard’s built-in Settings system.
- No external libraries required.
